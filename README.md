# Atlas

A D rectangle packer/texture atlas generator. It is compatible with `@nogc` and `nothrow`, and can be compiled with BetterC compatibility.

Check [source/atlas/package.d](https://github.com/ichordev/atlas/blob/main/source/atlas/package.d) for documentation.
Other modules are implementations of different packing methods.
